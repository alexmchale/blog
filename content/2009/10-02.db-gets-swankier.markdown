Today, I installed an SSL certificate onto SwankDB.  The web server is now
configured to redirect all unencrypted traffic through the encrypted channel.
This means that no matter how hard you try, it's virtually impossible to use
SwankDB and not have your data secure as it travels across the internet.

Doesn't that just give you the warm and fuzzies?  :-)
