Overview
--------

I'm a computer programmer with a passion for design and development. I enjoy
starting on a project from the bottom and driving it to completion.

I got my start writing software by programming for MUDs over telnet. I was
comfortable with UNIX before I ever used a Windows computer. In '96 or '97 I
discovered Linux and was thrilled with the chance to run something UNIX-like at
home.

Today, I love writing Ruby on OSX, both on Rails and off. I enjoy experimenting
with other languages. I have deployed several large projects in C and Java. I'm
trying to find the time to really figure out Erlang! I have been having fun
lately playing with node-js.

I have the enthusiasm to develop great software and the knowledge to get the
job done. I am excited about my field and about building systems that work for
real people.
