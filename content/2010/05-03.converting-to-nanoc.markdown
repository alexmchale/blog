Over the last few days I have migrated this blog from
[Wordpress](http://alexmchale.wordpress.com) to
[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/).  Nanoc is an awesome static site
generator. I've been having a lot of fun tuning it for my needs.

This site is now writting in HAML, SASS and Markdown. At the same time, I
converted my résumé to Markdown. I know the double é in résumé looks
pretentious, but I really just wanted an excuse to use the easy-to-type accents
in OSX.

I am keeping the source to this site posted on my GitHub at
[alexmchale/blog](http://github.com/alexmchale/blog). I don't know that it'll
be useful for anyone. Thanks to GitHub, it's strangely easier to open source
stuff than it is to keep it closed. I love those guys!
