A while back, our garbage disposal jammed up. It started with potato peels. I
typically don't let anything fall into the grinding hole, but not this time!
Wife told me that I could let a few peels go down and it would clean out the
drain. Being the smart-ass I am, I let 6 potatoes worth of peels go down.  JAM!

I had to pull out the pry bar to free it. It was not fun.

A few weeks later, the drain stops in the middle of dishes. It won't budge, no
water going down. I of course storm off to get the pry bar, mumbling about the
piece of junk garbage disposal.

After finding the tool and more unhappy words, I return to the sink.  It's at
this time that I realize that I had failed to remove the drain stopper. I
remove it, and the sink promptly empties.

Duh.

I got myself so bent out of shape over my assumption of what the problem was. I
think if I stopped letting my assumptions stress me out, I'd be a much happier
person.

My wife is the greatest woman in the world for putting up with me!
